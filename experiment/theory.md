\# PN Junction Theory and Mechanisms

## Theory

A **PN junction** is formed by bringing together p-type and n-type semiconductor materials. These semiconductors have distinct properties due to their doping:

- **P-Type:** Contains an excess of holes (majority carriers) and a few electrons (minority carriers) due to trivalent impurities (e.g., boron in silicon)
- **N-Type:** Contains an excess of electrons (majority carriers) and a few holes (minority carriers) due to pentavalent impurities (e.g., phosphorus in silicon)

When these materials join, two fundamental processes occur:
1. **Diffusion:** Majority carriers diffuse across the junction due to concentration gradients
2. **Drift:** An electric field develops that causes drift of carriers in the opposite direction. Drift flow of current is in opposite direction to diffusion current.

## Key Concepts and Physical Mechanisms

### 1. Formation of Depletion Region

When p-type and n-type semiconductors make contact:
- Electrons diffuse from n-type to p-type region, leaving behind immobile positive donor ions
- Holes diffuse from p-type to n-type region, leaving behind immobile negative acceptor ions
- This creates a **depletion region** (space charge region) containing exposed ionic charges
- The exposed ions create an internal **electric field** (E-field) that opposes further diffusion

The built-in potential (V_bi) across the junction at thermal equilibrium is:

$$ V_{bi} = \frac{kT}{q} \ln{\left( \frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2} \right)} $$

Where:
- k: Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K)
- T: Absolute temperature (K)
- q: Elementary charge (1.6 × 10^-19 C)
- N_a: Acceptor concentration in p-type region
- N_d: Donor concentration in n-type region
- n_i: Intrinsic carrier concentration

### 2. Electric Field and Charge Distribution

The electric field in the depletion region varies with position. For an abrupt junction:

$$ E(x) = \frac{qN_d}{\epsilon_s}(x + x_n) \quad \text{for } -x_n \leq x \leq 0 \text{ (n-side)} $$

$$ E(x) = \frac{qN_a}{\epsilon_s}(x - x_p) \quad \text{for } 0 \leq x \leq x_p \text{ (p-side)} $$

Where:
- ε_s: Semiconductor permittivity
- x_n, x_p: Depletion region widths in n and p regions

The total depletion width (W) follows:

$$ W = x_n + x_p = \sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_s}{q}\left(\frac{1}{N_a} + \frac{1}{N_d}\right)(V_{bi} - V_a)} $$

Where V_a is the applied voltage (positive for forward bias).

### 3. Current-Voltage Characteristics

#### Forward Bias

When V_a > 0, the current follows the diode equation:

$$ I = I_s\left(e^{\frac{qV_a}{nkT}} - 1\right) $$

Where:
- I_s: Reverse saturation current
- n: Ideality factor (1 for diffusion, 2 for recombination-dominated current)

The reverse saturation current is:

$$ I_s = qA\left(\frac{D_n}{L_n}n_p + \frac{D_p}{L_p}p_n\right) $$

Where:
- D_n, D_p: Diffusion coefficients
- L_n, L_p: Diffusion lengths
- n_p, p_n: Minority carrier concentrations

#### Reverse Bias

When V_a < 0:
- Depletion width increases
- Current saturates at -I_s until breakdown
- Minority carriers constitute the reverse current

### 4. Junction Capacitance

Two types of capacitance exist:

1. **Depletion (Junction) Capacitance:**
   $$ C_j = \frac{\epsilon_s A}{W} = \frac{C_{j0}}{\sqrt{1 - V_a/V_{bi}}} $$

2. **Diffusion Capacitance** (forward bias):
   $$ C_d = \frac{\tau I}{V_T} $$

Where:
- τ: Carrier lifetime
- V_T = kT/q: Thermal voltage

### 5. Temperature Effects

Temperature influences:
- Built-in potential (decreases with T)
- Reverse saturation current (increases exponentially with T)
- Bandgap (decreases with T)
- Carrier mobilities and diffusion coefficients

## Applications

PN junctions are fundamental to:
1. **Rectification:** AC to DC conversion
2. **Signal Detection:** Small-signal detection and mixing
3. **Voltage Regulation:** Using breakdown characteristics
4. **Photodetection:** Converting light to electrical signals
5. **Light Emission:** LEDs and laser diodes
