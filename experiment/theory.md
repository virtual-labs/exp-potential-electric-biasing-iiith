## **Theory**

A **PN junction** is formed by bringing together p-type and n-type semiconductor materials. These semiconductors have distinct properties due to the doping process:

- **P-Type:** Contains an abundance of holes (positive charge carriers) due to the presence of trivalent impurities (e.g., boron).
- **N-Type:** Contains an excess of electrons (negative charge carriers) due to the presence of pentavalent impurities (e.g., phosphorus).

When these materials are joined, the interaction between the majority carriers (holes in p-type and electrons in n-type) leads to the formation of a **depletion region** and an internal **electric field**.

### **Key Concepts and Formulas**

#### **1. Formation of Depletion Region and Built-In Potential**

- Electrons from the n-side diffuse into the p-side, where they recombine with holes, leaving behind positively charged donor ions on the n-side.
- Holes from the p-side diffuse into the n-side, recombining with electrons, leaving negatively charged acceptor ions on the p-side.
- This creates a region devoid of free carriers, called the **depletion region**, and a built-in electric field opposes further diffusion.

The built-in potential (\(V_{bi}\)) across the PN junction is given by:

\[
V_{bi} = \frac{kT}{q} \ln{\left( \frac{N_a \cdot N_d}{n_i^2} \right)}
\]

Where:  
- \(k\): Boltzmann constant (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\))  
- \(T\): Temperature (Kelvin)  
- \(q\): Electron charge (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\))  
- \(N_a\): Acceptor doping concentration  
- \(N_d\): Donor doping concentration  
- \(n_i\): Intrinsic carrier concentration of the material

#### **2. Electric Field and Charge Distribution**

Inside the depletion region, the charge distribution is due to the fixed ions (donors on the n-side and acceptors on the p-side). The electric field (\(E(x)\)) varies linearly across the depletion region:

\[
E(x) = \frac{q N_d}{\epsilon_s} \cdot x \quad \text{(for n-side)}
\]

\[
E(x) = -\frac{q N_a}{\epsilon_s} \cdot x \quad \text{(for p-side)}
\]

Where:  
- \(N_d\), \(N_a\): Donor and acceptor concentrations  
- \(\epsilon_s\): Permittivity of the semiconductor  

**Total Depletion Width (\(W\))** is the sum of the widths on the n-side (\(W_n\)) and p-side (\(W_p\)):

\[
W = W_n + W_p = \sqrt{\frac{2 \epsilon_s}{q} \cdot \frac{(N_a + N_d)}{N_a N_d} \cdot V_{bi}}
\]

#### **3. Forward and Reverse Bias**

- **Forward Bias:**  
  Applying a positive voltage to the p-side reduces the barrier potential, allowing current to flow. The current (\(I\)) in a forward-biased diode is given by:

  \[
  I = I_s \left( e^{\frac{qV}{kT}} - 1 \right)
  \]

  Where \(I_s\) is the reverse saturation current, and \(V\) is the applied voltage.

- **Reverse Bias:**  
  Applying a positive voltage to the n-side widens the depletion region, preventing current flow except for a small leakage current (\(I_s\)).

#### **4. Applications in Circuits**

In circuits, PN junctions are used in:  
- **Rectifiers:** Convert AC to DC by allowing current to flow only in one direction.  
- **Clippers and Clampers:** Shape waveforms by restricting voltage levels.  
- **Voltage Regulation:** Zener diodes exploit reverse breakdown.
