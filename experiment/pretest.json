      "question": "What is the primary role of the depletion region in a PN junction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To allow free movement of carriers",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The depletion region is devoid of free carriers.",
        "b": "Correct. The depletion region creates an electric field that opposes further diffusion.",

      "question": "What effect does reverse bias have on the current flow in a PN junction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It allows significant current to flow",
