      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The electric field responds differently to forward and reverse bias.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The relationship follows exponential decay due to recombination.",
        "b": "Correct. Minority carrier concentration decreases exponentially with distance due to recombination, following the diffusion equation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Concentration varies with distance due to recombination.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The relationship is exponential, not quadratic."

        "a": "Only affects reverse saturation current",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Diffusion length affects both forward and reverse currents.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Diffusion length affects both current components.",
        "c": "Correct. Longer diffusion lengths increase both forward current (by allowing carriers to travel further) and reverse saturation current (by increasing minority carrier collection).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Diffusion length significantly impacts current transport."

      "question": "What determines the temperature dependence of reverse saturation current in a PN junction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Only bandgap narrowing",

        "c": "Both intrinsic carrier concentration and minority carrier diffusion coefficient",
        "d": "Only minority carrier mobility"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While bandgap narrowing contributes, it's not the only factor.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Diffusion coefficient also plays a crucial role.",
        "c": "Correct. The reverse saturation current depends on both ni² (strong temperature dependence) and the diffusion coefficient (weaker temperature dependence).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Mobility alone doesn't determine temperature dependence."

      "question": "In a high-injection regime, how does the forward current-voltage relationship differ from low-injection?",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The relationship remains exponential but with modified parameters.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This describes recombination in the depletion region, not high injection.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Current still depends on voltage.",
        "d": "Correct. In high-injection, the voltage dependence is halved due to conductivity modulation and charge neutrality requirements."
