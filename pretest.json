      "question": "What is a PN junction, and what are its fundamental components?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A junction between two p-type semiconductors with different doping levels",
        "b": "A junction between two n-type semiconductors with different doping levels",
        "c": "A junction formed at the interface of p-type and n-type semiconductors, creating a depletion region",
        "d": "A junction between a semiconductor and a metal contact"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A PN junction must have both p-type and n-type regions, not just p-type materials with different doping.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A PN junction must have both p-type and n-type regions, not just n-type materials with different doping.",
        "c": "Correct. A PN junction is formed when p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined, creating a depletion region at their interface due to carrier diffusion.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This describes a metal-semiconductor junction (Schottky contact), not a PN junction."

      "question": "What physical mechanisms occur in the depletion region of a PN junction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Only electron diffusion from n-type to p-type region",
        "b": "Creation of an electric field that balances diffusion current with drift current",
        "c": "Only hole diffusion from p-type to n-type region",
        "d": "Continuous flow of current without any barrier"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Both electron and hole diffusion occur, and drift current is also present.",
        "b": "Correct. The depletion region creates an electric field that establishes equilibrium between diffusion and drift currents.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Both electron and hole diffusion occur, not just hole diffusion.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The depletion region actually creates a potential barrier to current flow."

    {
      "question": "How does forward biasing affect a PN junction's characteristics?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increases depletion region width and reduces potential barrier",
        "b": "Decreases depletion region width, reduces potential barrier, and enables significant current flow",
        "c": "Has no effect on the depletion region or current flow",
        "d": "Only affects the n-type region conductivity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Forward bias decreases (not increases) depletion width while reducing the potential barrier.",
        "b": "Correct. Forward bias reduces both depletion width and potential barrier, allowing significant current flow through the junction.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Forward bias significantly affects both depletion region width and current flow.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Forward bias affects both p-type and n-type regions and their interface."

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the built-in potential (V_bi) in a PN junction, and how is it calculated?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "V_bi = (kT/q)ln(Na×Nd/ni²); it represents the potential barrier that carriers must overcome",
        "b": "V_bi = kT/q; it represents the thermal voltage",
        "c": "V_bi = Na×Nd; it represents the doping concentration product",
        "d": "V_bi = ni²; it represents the intrinsic carrier concentration"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The built-in potential is the natural barrier voltage that develops across the junction and depends on doping concentrations and intrinsic carrier density.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is the thermal voltage formula, not the built-in potential.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is just the product of doping concentrations without the necessary logarithmic relationship.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This only represents the intrinsic carrier concentration squared."

    {
      "question": "How do drift and diffusion currents interact in a PN junction at equilibrium?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Drift current dominates and diffusion current is negligible",
        "b": "Diffusion current dominates and drift current is negligible",
        "c": "Drift and diffusion currents are equal and opposite, resulting in zero net current",
        "d": "Both currents flow in the same direction, adding together"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. At equilibrium, neither current dominates; they balance each other.",
        "b": "Incorrect. At equilibrium, neither current dominates; they balance each other.",
        "c": "Correct. At equilibrium, the drift current exactly balances the diffusion current, resulting in zero net current flow.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The currents flow in opposite directions to achieve equilibrium."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "What happens to carrier movement and current flow when a PN junction is reverse biased?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Majority carriers easily cross the junction, creating large current flow",
        "b": "Only minority carriers contribute to a small reverse saturation current",
        "c": "All carrier movement and current flow stops completely",
        "d": "Current flow reverses direction but maintains the same magnitude"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Reverse bias makes it harder for majority carriers to cross the junction.",
        "b": "Correct. Under reverse bias, only thermally generated minority carriers contribute to a small reverse saturation current.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A small reverse saturation current still flows.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The current magnitude is much smaller in reverse bias compared to forward bias."
