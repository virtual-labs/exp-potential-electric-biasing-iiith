### Aim of the experiment

This experiment aims to understand and visualize the fundamental mechanisms of carrier transport in a PN junction semiconductor device under different biasing conditions. Specifically, the objectives are:

1. To demonstrate the two primary carrier transport mechanisms in a PN junction:
   - Diffusion current due to concentration gradient
   - Drift current due to electric field

2. To understand how these mechanisms interact under:
   - Zero bias (equilibrium) condition
   - Forward bias condition
   - Reverse bias condition

3. To visualize and comprehend:
   - The movement of majority and minority carriers
   - The formation and modulation of the depletion region
   - The effect of applied voltage on carrier flow
   - The relationship between drift and diffusion currents

4. To develop a practical understanding of:
   - How carrier movement contributes to total current flow
   - The role of the built-in electric field
   - The impact of external bias on junction behavior
   - The balance between drift and diffusion processes

Through interactive simulation, students will gain hands-on experience in analyzing and predicting PN junction behavior under various operating conditions.
